# Optiworks (A simple software platform for topology optimization)
Optiworks provides an accessible and user-friendly solution for topology optimization, simplifying the entire process from domain initialization to the export of the final optimized design. The software integrates two powerful algorithms, SIMP and SEMDOT, allowing users to choose the most suitable method for their optimization goals. Optiworks offers additional features such as symmetry enforcement to accelerate optimization, static analysis for evaluating design changes on total displacement, equivalent strain, and von Mises stress, and the generation of smooth boundaries, even with coarse meshes. 


Implemented features
--------

- Interactive GUI
- Domain Intialization (Default and Abitrary)
- Intergration of SIMP and SEMDOT
- Static analysis for pre-optimized and post-optimized domain
- Exclusion of passive elements from the optimization
- Application of symmetry on the optimized domain
- Export of the final optimized domain
- Application of smooth boundaries to optimization



Installation
---------

Optiworks is currently available for Windows users, with installation files
accessible in https://github.com/thsmit/TopOpt_in_PETSc_wrapped_in_Python.git. The installation process follows standard procedures
for Windows applications. Users can install the software by executing the in-
